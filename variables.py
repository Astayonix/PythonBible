#No variable
print(1 + 1)

#Dynamically typed variables in Python
#First, number is an 'int' or Integer
number = 1 + 6
print(number)
print(type(number))

#Second, number is a 'str' or String
number = "hello"
print(number)
print(type(number))

#Third, number is a 'float' or a Floating Point number
number = 5.7
print(number)
print(type(number))

# More practice with variables
first_number = 1 + 1 + 6
print(first_number)
second_number = 105 + 10
print(second_number)

total_number = first_number + second_number
print(total_number)

# Variable Naming Standards
# myVariableName = CamelCase (start with lowercase, every new word gets Capitalized, no spaces, no underscores or hyphens) - Most popular in Java or Javascript
aNewNumber = 10

# MyVariableName = ProperCase (starts with uppercase, every new word gets Capitalized, no spaces, no underscores or hyphens)
ANewNumber = 30

# my_variable_name = SnakeCase (starts with lowercase, every new word is lowercase, no spaces, there are underscores, no hyphens) - Most propular in Python
a_new_number = 20

# variable assignment without assignment
fourth_number # produces an error
print(fourth_number)

# variable assignment with assignment
fourth_number = 10 # creates a variable named fourth_number with a value of 10
print(fourth_number)

# In this challenge, I want you to create a variable called x
# Set the value for x equal to any whole number you choose using the assignment operator
x = 50
print(x)
